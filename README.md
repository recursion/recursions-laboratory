## recursions-laboratory
A simple react application for sharing things about myself, and the projects I have built.

This site was built in a rather ad-hoc fashion, with a focus on getting something up and running, rather than long-term maintainability. There are no tests (not that many are needed).

With a few modifications this app could be very generic so that anyone could use it for their portfolio page.


Cloned from the boilerplate: https://github.com/flexdinesh/react-redux-boilerplate 

## Features

- Simple, mobile first / responsive design.
- Home page with intro/about me.
- Projects page that loads projects from json for easy modification/management.
- Searchable/Sortable skills page that loads skills from json for easy modification/management.
- Contact page with validations, that provides a form for communication, so you can keep your email private.
- Compact react components for easy modification.
- Bulma / SCSS for easy style changes.
