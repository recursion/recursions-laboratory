I have been tinkering with JS almost since it was first created, and while I still to check documention regularly (who has the memory not to?), I am very familiar with it's constructs, as well as employing the good parts, while avoiding the bad (I'm looking at you 'this')."

I have dabbled with BEM naming. All of that said, design is not my strong suite. I can generally get things laid out and working responsively, but it likely wont be the most attractive thing you ever saw! My concept of color schemes is pretty attrocioius."

I have a general grasp of relational models and normalization practices. This is one of those things where If I had to, I could get it working, but most likely it would need some refinement and optimizations."

I certainly understand Big O notation, and can generally determine if an algo falls within Constant, Linear, Quadratic or Logarithmic time. If its more mathmatically complex than one of those, I probably wouldnt be able to name it. I definitely will not be writing any ground breaking algos - but I generaly know enough to find one thats appropriate for my needs. Same goes for data structures - I wont be hand-coding any binary-search-trees, but I'll know when I need one, and how to find one that is well-implemented and tested."
